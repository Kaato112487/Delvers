The Frame Corporation was created when the First Regency Architecture and Construction, FRAC, company merged with Material Excavations, a stone mining company.  The FRAC was a company founded specifically for the construction and maintenance of government offices within the region, so it always had a great deal of influence.  Material Excavations provided them with most of their building supplies, so when the two companies decided to merge they formed F.R.A.M.E., or more commonly, Frame Corporation.  In more recent times, they do most of their work building structures inside the [[Spire Caves]].  Many tunnels were dug by them, and the materials are still being used for their work.
