Debatably the largest company in the city, two of the six piers in [[Riverside]] are directly financed and run by them.  Few goods move in and out of the city without their knowledge, and they have supplied the auction houses with much of their regular stock.  The current ownership is split between the immediate members of the current ruling generation of the Garrigan family; [[Kelsi Garrigan]], [[Eman Garrigan]], [[Rachael Loria]], [[Liesl Garrigan]], [[Eugene Garrigan]], [[Anita Garrigan]], and [[Victor Garrigan]].  Among these, Eugene primarily runs the company and handles day-to-day operations, Kelsi and Victor travel to bring in new contracts, and the others lavish themselves in the wealth of their heritage, occupying their days with their own works, projects, and whims.
