While they started as a simple carpenter’s guild, the Happy Hammer has adopted a strange religious bend which all of their members must follow.  Members of the Happy Hammer are taught that as the earth provides the materials they carve into their works, living beings crafted into finery, that they too must craft themselves into fine works of art to obtain the joy of being one with their craft.  Mandatory morning and evening exercise, ornate tattoos, piercings, and jewelry, and elaborate clothing makes these members stand out within the city.  It is a requirement that all changes, even to the typical manner of dress, be approved by the guild to ensure no two members appear two similar.
