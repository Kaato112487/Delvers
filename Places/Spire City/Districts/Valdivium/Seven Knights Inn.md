Split off from the [[Seven Knights Tavern]], the door is directly beside it and leads to a very small entranceway.  A desk directly to the left and a staircase straight ahead leading up to a landing and hairpin turn is all that’s present on the first floor.  Heading just beside the stairs, there is a door leading out back.  While it’s not a high-end establishment, the accommodations are comfortable and well put together.  There are 6 rooms on the second floor, as the first has been turned into storage and an office and the second is [[Alek Holmes|Alek]]'s room, and 9 on the third, with a small room being situated above the foyer and stairs.

Every room features at least a bed, dressing table, small mirror of polished brass, small basin or washpot, and, as their primary selling point, access to water from a large tank atop the building just by pulling a chain.  Releasing the chain cuts the flow of water, and they ask you don’t use too much.  The accomodations are perhaps a bit higher end than most guests might be able to afford, as dormitories are more common in the city.  This inn primarily caters to merchants and other well-to-do travelers.
