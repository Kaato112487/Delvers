Spire city is home to some 25 thousand persons at any time, plus visitors.  It’s broken into seven main districts, plus the township of Riverside.  There are many things to do within the city, and many services available.  The prices listed here are welcome to adjustment, but are recommended for the balance currently used in the game.

## Downtime

At the beginning of each session where the players resume not in an active state, or during any available pause during gameplay, players will have the option for downtime activities.  Players should record the time spent on the activities and the result, as determined by the GM.  For full details, see the D&D basic rules, but some examples of downtime activities may include:
-   Crafting
-   Practicing a skill
-   Recuperating
-   Providing labor or a service for pay
-   Training
-   Socializing

You may choose appropriate rolls for each to determine the success of the activity and determine what gains, if any, the character receives.  Some activities may come with expenses, so those should be considered as well.

## Services
Many services are available within the city, and some may also be available within pocket dimension towns.  Certain backgrounds may gain an advantage when obtaining certain services, which should be considered when the player requests them.  For example, a Criminal may get better and cheaper information, an Acolyte may receive certain benefits when purchasing spellcasting services, or a noble might gain access to services not otherwise available.

## Earning Money
### Day Labor
There are always jobs which need to be done throughout the city.  The Docks need workers to unload shipments, the market vendors may need deliveries, and the guild halls will often look for small tasks to be taken care of, like postal services or hired help.  Many of the aristocrats in the city have full time staff, but will still hire temporary workers for events or if staff are short at the moment.

### Regular Employment
Guild halls exist throughout the city and will gladly certify any dues paying members.  Guilds for almost any common profession exist within the city, such as culinary, carpentry, alchemy, smithing, leatherworkers, armorers, painters, masons, and more.  There are typically multiple guilds for each practice to promote competition.

Companies also exist within the city that provide various services, typically with employees belonging to their respective guilds.  These companies provide services often more specialized or beyond the scope

### Risky Business
If looking for work, he’ll recommend a few places; the docks, market, the guild halls, and construction work in North Ward.  For slightly riskier work, there’s the arena, and probably some of the guild halls, depending on what they need done.  Each watch post, like the one across the street, would also have a few bounty posters out.  Beyond that, a bit of luck or connections might get you in good regard with an aristocrat, but honestly, the arena is your best bet, if betting is your thing.
