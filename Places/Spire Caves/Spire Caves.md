## Boundless Contents 

The geometry of the interior of the spire isn’t bound by the space in its exterior.  Pocket dimensions have opened creating spaces containing expansive worlds with tenuous connections between them.  Travelling down a tunnel and opening a door could be linked to the front door of a small cottage in a field, the sky and crops expanding toward the horizon in all directions.  Climbing a staircase may lead to the next floor down where, but descending again could lead to yet another place entirely.  Imagine portals and non-euclidean geometry everywhere, so the caves may contain anything and everything, making them even more difficult to navigate.  Feel free to add to these maps portals to almost any place imaginable, though they need not all be two-way.

## Rare Treasures

Some treasures and artifacts grow or spontaneously appear within the caves.  A book, the pages formed from crystal and the words written by embedded ruby, or a ring of gold and diamond may grow directly from the floors and walls.  Many delvers have come before you, so any of their equipment and gains may be found upon their bodies, if a body remains.

## Maps

Though chaotic in design, the shape of the caves is fairly stable unless altered by an outside hand.  Maps have been made to try and guide delvers as far as their predecessors have traversed, though they are quite difficult to read and write for those not trained.  After all, even the way a door is opened can sometimes change where it leads.
