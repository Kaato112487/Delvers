## Hook 1 - Encountering the Local

If one or more players play a character that has lived in the city for some time, this may be a good hook to bring the party together.  A local would be familiar with the districts of the city and how to get other players the things they seek, for the right price.  This path would be used in addition to any other paths required to bring the rest of the party into the scene, and would allow a bit of exploration into why each group is there.  Does the local need money?  Are they looking to put a group together to gain access into the [[Spire Caves|caves]]?  Do they already have permission to enter the caves, or are they hoping to get some poor suckers to either fund it or win the favor of someone who can?  The Local would know the biggest names in town and have information about how to find whatever you might need, but they might just as easily be in it for themselves and looking to scam someone.

## Hook 2 - By Invitation

Have one or more of your party members already made a contact or a name for themselves?  They may be invited to the city to fulfill a certain task or to honor a contract, or maybe even as a guest!  Merchants and aristocrats are often invited to the city by their peers, and it’s not unusual for one to hire a group to take them into the caves.  Maybe one of those players has a wealth of history and a history of wealth.

## Hook 3 - Knowledge Seeker

While many can find knowledge in the books and halls of other cities, to experience the chaotic magic that fills the air directly can often be the best teacher.  Enrollment at school is unlikely, as education is more intended for the youth in [[Spire City]], but the [[Research Library]] might be more the desire of your players.  Perhaps the only institution within the city that has more sway with the local government than them would be the [[Arcane Tower]], but access to the Tower’s resources are frankly unlikely.  You may, however, encounter some of their wizards and sorcerers within the city and caves, and having them in your debt can only be to your benefit.  After all, access to anything good in this city, like the library or tower, is so controlled that you might have no other option.

## Hook 4 - On the Run

Criminals and nobles alike may be on the run.  Who can say what they’re running from, a sordid past, a social uprising, a jilted lover, or perhaps just to start over and renounce their former selves.  Spire City isn’t the largest in the world, but is uniquely suited to allowing a person to disappear.
