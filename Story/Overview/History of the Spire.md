The cause of this spire is lost to records, as none involved would be able to tell the tale.  As it often happens with these matters, the actions of powerful evil thwarted by bold heroes never reach the ears of the common folk if there were no witnesses.  So many forgotten tales litter the world, this may be among their greatest, as it was nearly their last.

All people have heard or seen stories of the great power of magic: A wizard and sorcerers could raise the dead, conjure demons, or even influence the flow of time; Warlocks and clerics, each conduit of the power of their patron, were capable of unworldly power that could enforce or topple armies; and the myriad of magical artifacts that were so great in themselves as to raise ordinary men to kings.  Yet with all of these great forces, few people considered what result might befall the world if too many were gathered at once.

A single wizard brought an answer to that question, using powerful artifacts and magics, he and his allies brought forth a strength of magic in concert that hadn’t been seen.  To oppose them, several heroes banded together and assailed the small tower in the dale where the spire now stands.  Should any find their way within the maze of the spire to the location where the battle ended, they would see the final moments, trapped in an endless cycle of for all eternity.

A rogue in the midst of using two pocket dimensions to create a planar gate; one Wizard casting a most powerful of spells, attempting to undo the effects; a sorcerer trying to stop time and a warlock attempting to counter it, artifacts on their bodies are reflecting the spells from their intended targets; a demonic servant battles a golden dragon, tooth, claw, and wing beating in the melee; and a crowd of fighters and beasts, gnashing and cutting at each other to vie for control all toward a central dais upon which rests a jade crystalline orb, the target of everyone’s attention; and a warrior, sword in hand, striking the orb in a hasty, off-balanced movement.  All inside are cognisant of the time loop within which they are trapped, knowing they will never escape.

This scene cannot be penetrated from the outside, and plays out in slow motion, each actor returning to their original position every 6 seconds.  As the scene resets, a wave of chaotic magical energy emits, and it is this which continues to fuel and reshape the spire.  Shortly before the original incident, the spire of earth had been conjured and warded around the tower by a small group of wizards outside, attempting to contain the threat, and likely fallout, within.  They did not survive the encounter either, killed by the minions outside after their spell was complete and taking with them the last memories of what occurred that day.
