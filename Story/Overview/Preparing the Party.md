Players are encouraged to explore and flesh out their back stories as much as possible.  The motivations, personalities, and backgrounds of each character will help you, as the GM, to bring their character into the story.  There is no requirement that all players begin the game as part of a single party, as many differing motivations will bring people to Spire City, but you should guide them into encountering the rest of the group.

This adventure is written for a party of 3-5 people of character levels 3-7, but can accommodate weaker parties through either additional tasks within the town prior to entering the caves or adjusting the difficulty of earlier encounters.  For characters above level 10 or larger parties, the structure of the cave can be adjusted to make them more rapidly progress to more difficult areas.  All aspects of this campaign are written as though the average party level is 4 for a party of 4 characters.  If the total party level is more than 22, the party may be too strong for early areas, and if it is more than 30, they may be too strong for most mid-game areas as well, missing too much content.

If there is an insistence on having such a high level party, consider how the party can be challenged, outside of raw combat strength, such as introducing more difficult environment challenges or making magic more chaotic.  Consider the strengths and weaknesses of the entire group.
