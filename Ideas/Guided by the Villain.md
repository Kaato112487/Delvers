The overall villain of the story is actually guiding the party to become stronger.  Creatures that could kill them being banished, unexpected rescues, easy fights to build XP, etc.  Because they've got a connection with the shield paired with the warrior's sword, he's looking for them to be reunited in the hope that the power would allow him to be free of his time-loop prison, even if it means the loss of his precious orb and all of his plans.  The party's success is only because of his guiding hand.
