A room where heavy mist is constantly being blown in, magically, by an artifact on the wall.  Dispelling it will remove the mist for only a single turn.  Accomplish this in roll 20 by having LOS blocking running through the middle of every square, so players can see half of each tile around them.  While in the mist, you are blind to anything more than 5 feet away, and the sound of rushing air coming from the artifact as it continues to release this fog will deafen creatures that get too close.
