There are multiple types of illusions.  Visual and auditory illusions are the most simple, convincing creatures they can see or hear something that isn't real or tangible.  These are easily seen through and cannot be interacted with.  Overlapping illusions change the figure of things which are real, making them harder to detect and scrutinize.  A door made to look like part of the wall, it feels much the same when you touch it, unless you happen to hit the handle.  Hallucinatory illusions are tricky, as they can convince a single creature only of the illusions, making the party guess which is real and which is fake.  Putting a floor extending over a cliff is a simple example of this, as it can be examined, but more convincing instances might be illusory script different for each player.  The last would be Hypnotic Illusions, an extension on the Hallucinatory Illusions where the creature actively believes the illusion is real and suffers effects regarding it.  They might put their hand on a non-existent wall and be unable to push through, because their mind has convinced them the wall is there.  These would likely be the most targeted, to avoid railroading the party too much.
