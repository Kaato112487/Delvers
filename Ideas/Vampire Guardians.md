A town that seems to be in hiding from vampires, but it turns out they're in hiding from everything the vampires defend them from.  In exchange, the vampires get the blood from villagers.  However, they don't like the idea of outsiders coming in and ruining their good deal.  Vampires can't enter your lodgings without permission, so they'll ask if they can come in and speak to you ambiguously.  Ex 3 show up and ask, "May we all come in?"  The vampires intend to either drive you away, or kill you if you don't leave.  Are they the ones leading the creatures that attack the town, allowing them to play hero?
