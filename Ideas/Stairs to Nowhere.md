A large room with a staircase in the middle.  The stairs aren't magical in any way, and just lead to nowhere.  Around the stairs is a ring of N (size of party-1) circles, which appear to have emblems in the shape of feet when closely inspected.  Getting the party members to stand on them causes all of the latches holding the floor to unlock and the floor to begin sliding down.  Once settled at the bottom, the stairs actually lead up to a door/passageway, and you've gone far enough down that it wouldn't be easy to get back up.
