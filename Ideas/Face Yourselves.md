## Face Yourselves

A room with a mirror wall that’s indestructible.  Note everything the players do in the room.  Later, they’ll come back, but on the other side of the mirror, and see their past selves doing the same things as earlier.  Interacting with the mirror will cause each reflected self to distort as they become aware of you (think drrr, drrr, drrr).  They will then attack and will have enhanced abilities of each party member they’ve copied. Once enough people from either party have fallen such that the total number remaining equals the size of the party at the time they first entered the mirror room, then a blinding light will temporarily fill the room.  Any of the dead disappear and in the place of any living reflections are members of the party that fell.  Everyone is back to full health and spell slots, like a long rest has occurred, and they are back on the side of the mirror they stood at first.  Even party members that died before making it to the reflected side are back.  “Did everything since leaving that room happen?” is the question that lingers in the air.  For the DM, the answer is yes, and every party member resurrected by the reflected self should be noted.  Another creature or trap will later be able to use this against them.  Possible uses:

### Mirror/Mirror

A second mirrored room, but the ones that died don’t appear in the mirror reflection.  They are the only ones that may pass through this mirror unimpeded.

### Friend or Foe

The players are divided into two groups based on whether or not they survived before.  Each group sees the other as the distorted form, and those who survived have a spell cast upon them or suffer madness, something like that.

### People See the Truth

People in a certain area might fear those revived by the reflections, as though they can see the original monster
