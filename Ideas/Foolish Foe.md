One of the foppish aristocrats, probably [[Eman Garrigan]], will have a "discovered" criminal enterprise.  In truth, the party just ended up there by accident and never has any indication there's criminal activity.  He accuses them of spying and intends to have them killed, assured that any questions about their searching could be covered up by his connections.  He quite elaborately describes his incorrect assumptions about why you're there, revealing a great deal about his activities.  His guards may be strong, but he's a pushover.  Killing him would probably have ***SEVERE*** consequences.
