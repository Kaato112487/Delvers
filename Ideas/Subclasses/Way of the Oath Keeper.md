# Way of the Oath Keeper
A monk on this path is as strong as his word, and his word is directly bound to his life.  Should he ever defy an oath, the consequences would be considerable.  Oaths may take many forms, and may be used as a mantra to help these monks focus themselves single-mindedly on a task, accomplishing it with skill beyond their normal abilities.

## Words of Power
##### *3rd-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
The language of an oath defines its power, and the careful choice of words helps the monk craft the oath exactly as they intend.  Some may find their actions confusing, even accusing them of being deceptive in their promises, but the letter of the oath is all that matters.

You gain proficiency in the Persuasion and Deception skills.

## Oath of Mercy
##### *3rd-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
You swear upon your own life that another shall not pass from this world before you for as long as you can prevent it.  As an action, you can place your hand upon a creature and swear this oath.  If the target creature takes damage from any source that would reduce it to 0 hit points while you are conscious and on the same plane of existence, reduce it to 1 hit point and prevent that creature from taking any further damage until the start of its next turn.  When this happens, your hit points are immediately reduced to 0 as the oath is fulfilled and ended.  You may only swear one Oath of Mercy at a time.

## Oath of Victory
##### *3rd-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
As a bonus action you may expend 1 ki point to declare your impending victory over another creature that you can see.  The oath lasts for one minute before it is considered broken.  If the target creature dies during your turn or as a direct result of one of your actions, such as being thrown from a cliff, the oath is fulfilled.  Otherwise the oath is considered broken.  If the oath is broken, reduce your current hit points by half or twice your monk level, whichever is greater.

While the oath is sworn, if you hit the target creature with an attack that deals martial arts damage, you may roll an additional martial arts die once per turn.  Additionally, you may expend 1 ki point to gain advantage on all attacks against that creature until the start of your next turn.  You may only swear one Oath of Victory at a time.

## Oath of Truth
##### *6th-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
