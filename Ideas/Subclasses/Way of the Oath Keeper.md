# Way of the Oath Keeper
A monk on this path is as strong as his word, and his word is directly bound to his life.  Should he ever defy an oath, the consequences would be considerable.  Oaths may take many forms, and may be used as a mantra to help these monks focus themselves single-mindedly on a task, accomplishing it with skill beyond their normal abilities.

## Words of Power
##### *3rd-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
The language of an oath defines its power, and the careful choice of words helps the monk craft the oath exactly as they intend.  Some may find their actions confusing, even accusing them of being deceptive in their promises, but the letter of the oath is all that matters.

You gain proficiency in the Persuasion and Deception skills.

## Oath of Mercy
##### *3rd-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
You swear upon your own life that another shall not pass from this world before you for as long as you can prevent it.  As an action, you can place your hand upon a creature and swear this oath.  If the target creature takes damage from any source that would reduce it to 0 hit points while you are conscious and on the same plane of existence, reduce it to 1 hit point and prevent that creature from taking any further damage until the start of its next turn.  When this happens, your hit points are immediately reduced to 0 as the oath is fulfilled and ended.  You may only swear one Oath of Mercy at a time.

## Oath of Victory
##### *3rd-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
As a bonus action you may expend 1 ki point to declare your impending victory over another creature that you can see.  The oath lasts for one minute before it is considered broken.  If the target creature dies during your turn or as a direct result of one of your actions, such as being thrown from a cliff, the oath is fulfilled.  Otherwise the oath is considered broken.  If the oath is broken, reduce your current hit points by half or twice your monk level, whichever is greater.

While the oath is sworn, if you hit the target creature with an attack that deals martial arts damage, you may roll an additional martial arts die once per turn.  Additionally, you may expend 1 ki point to gain advantage on all attacks against that creature until the start of your next turn.  You may only swear one Oath of Victory at a time.

## Oath of Truth
##### *6th-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
When hearing any statement you can understand, you can swear to the veracity of that statement.  After a creature makes a statement, you may declare it to either be true or false.  The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Ki save DC.  If the creature fails this saving throw and the truth of the statement, from the perspective of the creature, does not match your assertion, you take damage equal to your martial arts die.  If the creature succeeds on the saving throw or the statement does match the truth of your assertion, nothing happens.  You cannot swear an oath on a single statement multiple times.

## Oath of Restriction
##### *11th-level Way of the Oath Keeper feature*
As an action, make an unarmed strike against a creature.  You may roll damage as normal, but this strike does not count as an Attack.  If this strike hits the target, you may expend 4 ki points to swear an oath upon yourself and the target.  The oath may be any of those Binding Oaths listed below.  If either one of you, or both of you, break this oath, you suffer 5d10 force damage and the oath is ended only for the one that broke it.  This oath lasts until the next dawn or until one of the oath-bound is unconscious before it is fulfilled.  You may have multiple Oath of Restrictions against only a single creature at a time.

#### Binding Oath of Dueling
While both of you are conscious, any attack against a creature not oath-bound is forbidden.

#### Binding Oath of Courage
Any movement that is not forced movement which increases the distance between the oath-bound is forbidden.

#### Binding Oath of Simplicity
Casting any spell or using any class feature is forbidden.

#### Binding Oath of Attrition
You immediately regain 1d8 + Proficiency Bonus hit points.  At the start of each of your turns, roll 1 martial arts die.  The oath-bound both take this damage.  Being healed by any source is forbidden.

#### Binding Oath of Blood
You gain advantage on attacks against target creature.  It is forbidden to end your turn without having dealt damage to any creature.

#### Binding Oath of Respite
The oath-bound are paralyzed until the end of the target's next turn.  Allowing the other oath-bound creature to take damage is forbidden.
