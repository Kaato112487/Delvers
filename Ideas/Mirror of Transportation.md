A door stands in a room with two hand mirrors, a double-headed key, and two locks.  Anything entering one mirror will exit the other, and magical items will glow while entering the mirror.  The key does so, too, but because it's magic is to open the otherwise unpickable lock.  The key must be placed into the mirror, but not pushed all the way through, then both mirrors held up to the locks, then the key rotated to open the door.  The party may take the mirrors with them, but they have a maximum functional range of only about 30 feet.  If shattered, anything currently being transported is severed.
