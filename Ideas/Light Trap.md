If characters create a light source in a room, that lightsource casts shadows that become part of the creature that dwells within the room.  The greater the amount of shadow in the room, the higher the AC and damage of the creature.  The creature may not attack any creature within the shadows.  Using sufficient light, the creature may be cut off from other shadows and compressed into a small enough shadow to be attacked, where its AC becomes effectively 0.
