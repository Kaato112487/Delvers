He's both a character and the landscape.  Too large to move properly anymore, what movements he can manage change the massive landscape that's built atop him.  An ageless monk, a bit of magic gone wrong caused an Enlarge spell to repeat dozens of times and become permanent.  He has become a part of the landscape, living forever in his eternal meditative torment.
