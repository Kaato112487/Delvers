The only worker at the [[Seven Knights Inn]], beyond [[Alek Holmes]] himself.  Although she does help out with maintaining the rooms, his personality means that he’s often neatened and cleaned after a guest before she’s had a chance to step foot in the room.  She’s not lazy, he’s just too eager to organize and often gets there before her.  As such, she normally handles guiding people to their rooms and explaining the amenities, only helping clean when there’s a particular rush.  She also arranges any meals the guests may need with the [[Seven Knights Tavern]], to avoid any of the inevitable fights between the brothers.  Officially, she has a room in [[The Boroughs]], but many people have taken note of how rarely she seems to leave the inn in the evenings.
