Owner and proprietor of the [[Seven Knights Inn]], he is a lean man, almost thin, of average height.  His brother, [[Barnaby Holmes]], runs the [[Seven Knights Tavern]], though the relationship is strained between them. He is always neatly dressed, and takes pride in the orderliness of his establishment.  While not a gregarious man, he’s pleasant and kind, sometimes to a fault.  He keeps the Seven Knights well adorned with amenities and decoration without it being too ostentatious.  While officially unmarried, everyone acknowledges with a wink his relationship with [[Claire Chisholm]].  Nobody is quite sure why they don’t make their relationship official.
