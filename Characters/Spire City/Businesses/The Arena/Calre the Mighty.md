A Leonin warrior and champion of the arena, she has never lost a match in her career.  Rarely speaking, the crowds cheer even her mere presence, and the movement of a single hand is enough to silence them.  Despite her title and record, she hasn't fought in the arena in several years, often leaving the battles to [[Dion Sunchaser]], her protege and the Interim Champion.  It's been many years since Dion lost a battle, and without defeating him nobody has the chance to challenge Calre.  Her taciturn nature is more a matter of boredom, finding the arena life uninteresting with her skill, but being bound by contract to retain her title.
