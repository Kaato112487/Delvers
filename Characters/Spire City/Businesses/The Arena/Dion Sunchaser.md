A Leonin warrior and interim champion of the arena, he is the last remaining member of the pride of [[Calre the Mighty]].  Neither talk much about the past, and he knows she would rather return to her home to rebuild, but they are bound by the contract and need for money to the arena.  Dion himself is quite a capable warrior, but has never challenged Calre to see which has greater skill because he acknowledges it's very likely her.  His more social and amicable nature makes him the more natural crowd favorite over Calre, despite the respect she commands.  He is large and strong, wield his great axe, and his skills give him enormous pride.  When paired against opponents he believes are too weak, he often looks at them with haughty pity, preferring to defeat them in a swift, yet humiliating, way to get them to give up on the arena and preserve their life.  Only the strongest enemies have ever died at his blade.
