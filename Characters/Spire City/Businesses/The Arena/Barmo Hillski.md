His father is a human, his mother a half dwarf, half halfling, Barmo has adopted the strangest combination of traits from each.  Standing about 4'8", 70lbs, he's quite tall for a halfling, but short for a human.  Though he does not shave his beard, it doesn't grow in any way that would be expected from a dwarf, looking more like long mutton chops.  Unable to grow any hair under his nose, even on his chin, his appearance can only be described as unique.  He fights in the arena, but has perhaps the worst record of any fighter in their history, yet somehow emerges without any serious injury from his losses.  Standing sturdy in his armor with a mace in hand, he tries to fight like his dwarven kin until his strength fails, then relying more on luck and wit.  Despite the losses, he's always got a good spirit toward anyone he feels beat him cleanly and never gives up on the arena.
