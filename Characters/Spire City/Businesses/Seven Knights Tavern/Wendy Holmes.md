The 5 year old daughter of [[Barnaby Holmes]] and [[Ciara Holmes]], she takes after her father in terms of conversation.  She probably draws in just as many customers, with her adorable and whimsical stories she tells, sitting perched upon the [[Seven Knights Tavern|bar]].  She earned the nickname **Windy**, because once she started talking, “the wind never stopped blowing.”
