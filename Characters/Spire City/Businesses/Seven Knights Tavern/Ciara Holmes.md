[[Barnaby Holmes|Barnaby]]’s wife of 6 years.  Now that their daughter is old enough to stay out of trouble, she’s back to helping in the tavern.  She’s taken charge of pouring the drinks and handling the money, making her the backbone of the [[Seven Knights Tavern]].  It’s not uncommon for there to be other parents around the bar, just to spend time with little “[[Wendy Holmes|Windy]],” who often sits on the bar and talks to *everyone*.
