Barmaid and occasional cook, though she mainly helps with the prep work.  Her [[Kyre Jannison|twin sister]] actually works in the [[city office]], approving entries into the [[Spire Caves]].  While some might think her to be envious of her sister’s more prominent position, she knows she’s much happier in a job where she can socialize with people in a light-hearted setting.
