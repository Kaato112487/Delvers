## Overview

^41b442

Eldest child of the [[Garrigan Family]], Kelsi had a strong business savvy from a young age.  Her father, [[Maxwell Garrigan]], had inherited the already successful company and would often entertain guests at their [[Garrigan Family Estate|villa]] within the city.  At the various events, parties, balls, and galas, that her family sponsored, Kelsi quickly became the talk of the city.  By 16 she had a half-dozen would be husbands vying for her attentions, by 20 she'd taken controlling shares in their companies and driven them out, and by 26 she had assumed leadership of the company from her father, who had passed suddenly.  Charming, ruthless, and affable, there are always whispers of misdeed surrounding Kelsi, but never any evidence, and her public persona is often too majestic that it actually arouses more suspicion.  32 years old, she now sits as matriarch of the family following her mother's death.

## Relationships
- [[Maxwell Garrigan]] - Her father and mentor, Kelsi learned everything she knows from him.  Both doting and stern, she was often pressed to meet his high standards, but would be lavished with praise when she did.
- [[Eman Garrigan]] - Her younger brother by 2 years, she supports his loafing about as long as he doesn't do anything public that will ruin their image.  He understands his place, and hasn't stepped out of line in many years.  He follows her, but holds very little loyalty to her as an individual, as his pride is in the family name.
- [[Rachael Loria]] - Eman's twin sister, Kelsi had high expectations for the relationship they would share.  While they are certainly on good terms, they could never have the tight sisterly bond that Kelsi had envisioned as a child.  Things only worsened when she decided to marry [[Deckard Loria]], a merchant who often traded with the family.  To Kelsi's relief, the two decided to leave the city and have an associate handle the trades from now on.
- [[Liesl Garrigan]] - A man of great stature, Liesl often felt more comfortable using his muscles than his brain.  Fortunately, Kelsi found a good use for him, and he often will handle business for Eugene that the smaller man doesn't have the presence to accomplish.
- [[Eugene Garrigan]] - In contrast to his elder brother, Eugene is small and bookish.  His often annoyingly pedantic nature belies his incredible mental abilities, and he runs the day to day operations of the company.  In his mind, Kelsi is the face of the business, but he's the one actually pulling the strings.
- [[Anita Garrigan]] - The youngest sister, conceived not long before her father's death.  Kelsi has a soft spot for Anita like no other, and often dotes on the little girl.  She is the only family member that Kelsi does not look at and assess the business value of, instead just being happy that she's there.
- [[Victor Garrigan]] - Adopted into the family, Victor uses the Garrigan name but doesn't come from any family of note.  A man of unparalleled charm, he travels to meet clientele with Kelsi, and they are seldom apart.  Rumors swirl of the nature of their relationship.
