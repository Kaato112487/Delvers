## Overview
Adopted son of the Garrigan family, he was 13 when [[Maxwell Garrigan]] met him first.  A child of no notable background, his family worked within the spire mining minerals for the [[Frame Corporation]].  During one expedition, his parents and elder brother all went missing, presumed dead, within the caves and left Victor as an orphan.  He began working odd jobs to make a living, eventually working at the [[Garrigan Family Estate]] as a stable hand.  During a fateful gala, a guest's horse was spooked and drove wild with the carriage.  Without hesitation, Victor jumped astride its back, covered its eyes, and calmed it before anyone could get injured.  His actions earned him the favor and attention of Maxwell Garrigan, leading him to hold a better position within the staff.  Eventually, a 15 year old Victor has become the personal butler and confidant of Maxwell, often having discussions of their business when his quick wit and foresight are discovered.  By 18, Maxwell had decided to adopt him into the family, seeing him as both worthy to carry the Garrigan name and a capable lieutenant to aid his daughter, [[Kelsi Garrigan]], in running the family business.
