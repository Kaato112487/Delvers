# Thoughts on Mimics

Mimics are obviously able to manifest themselves into complex designs, such as chests, wooden walls, crafted tables, and more.  This means that their ability to camouflage must be akin to shape shifting, and must be much more versatile than most shapeshifters are capable of.  They seem to prefer inorganic or constructed shapes, but they do not copy the properties of the material they appear to be, only the look.  They should only be used sparingly, but in the most unexpected places.  Best of all, there is no rule that says a mimic must strike immediately.  The party could pick up a book and have it in their pack for hours before pulling it out and only being attacked at that moment.  Mimics might have a goal of reuniting before attacking, such as a Key mimic waiting until it's near the Door mimic.
