   desc: Despite their thin, nearly transparent wings, a locust dragon is still capable of flight.  However, it cannot hover and must keep moving.
 - name: Stomach Dimension
   desc: A creature consumed by a locust dragon is transported into a pocket dimension.  If the locust dragon dies, the creature reappears at a random location within 100 feet, typically determined by rolling 2d20 and using one result as row and one result as column.  If the locust dragon enters any extradimensional space, treat it the same as a Bag of Holding.

   desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target.  Hit: 17 (2d8+7) Piercing damage.  On hit the target is grappled"
 - name: Consume
   desc: A grappled target is eaten whole.  While a target is being consumed, the target is Paralyzed and the locust dragon is Restrained and Incapacitated.  A creature is consumed at the start of a locust dragon's later turn, with the number of rounds being determined by the target's size.  If the locust dragon takes damage, Consume is interrupted and the target is freed.  A tiny creature takes 1 turn, a small creature takes 2 turns, and a medium creature takes 3 turns to consume.

Locust Dragon's normally attack in numbers, much like their insect namesake, and are not considered dragons by any other dragon species.  They abhor water and find it difficult to move while submerged, but can dry their thin wings quickly once they make it onto land.  Despite its name and reputation for swallowing farmers and livestock whole, a locust dragon is actually unable to digest any of what they eat.  Their bodies act much like a bag of holding, keeping all they consume in a pocket dimension.    This is actually the source of their insatiable appetite, as the dragons still feel the need to eat, but don't receive the satisfaction of having finished a meal.
