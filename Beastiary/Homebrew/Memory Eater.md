 - name: "Siphon"
   desc: "Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 240ft., one target.  Hit: 6 (1d4+3) psychic damage.  On hit, roll 2d6 to determine what memory is consumed from the target, based on the values listed in Integrated Thoughts.  If there are multiple possible options within that type of memory, such as two languages, the one consumed is chosen at random."
 - name: "Disorient (Recharge 6)"
   desc: The Memory Eater emits a flood of mental energy in a 30 foot radius.  Every other creature must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or become mentally muddled.  A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  While muddled, that creature's thoughts are so fleeting that they cannot figure out what they're doing or who they're around.  They may can choose to move, take an action, or take a bonus action on their turn, but cannot do more than one of those.  At the start of each turn, roll 1d4 to determine a direction, with 1 representing north and rotating clockwise.  All movement, spellcasting, and attacks must be made in a cone in that direction relative to your starting position.
