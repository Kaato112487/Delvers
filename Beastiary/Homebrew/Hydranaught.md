 - name: Hydra?
   desc: This Hydra is a bit confused.  Dealing 25 or more damage in a single turn causes you to chop off its head from a body.  At the end of its turn, it grows two bodies for each of its bodies that was severed since its last turn, unless it has taken non-magical Bludgeoning damage since its last turn.  The Hydra? regains 10 hit points for each body regrown in this way.
