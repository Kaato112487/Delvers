Actually a rather lonely and shy creature, the Fog Walker doesn't seek to harm anyone unless angered first.  Few know of the true shape of its body, as the darkness that shrouds it persists after its death.  Any part of its torso or head which is separated will become a new source for the shroud of darkness, just as if it were the whole creature.  Their body and legs are not very tall, normally standing around 5 feet, but their arms are exceptionally long, allowing them to just barely extend their hands beyond the edge of the darkness.  Their body and limbs are generally quite thin.

The Fog Walkers origins are unknown, but they are considered to have been cursed to remain in darkness some centuries back because of the grotesque shape of their body.  In truth, they are mild tempered and often long for greater community.  They wander with only limited knowledge of the world around them, and have been known to physically cling to other creatures that are friendly to them, wrapping their bodies around them.
