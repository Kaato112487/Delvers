# Delvers

A slightly homebrewed campaign for 5e.  This campaign is designed for characters level 1-5 of party sizes 3-5, but can be adapted to any number or strength.  Parts of the city may be skipped for stronger characters, as they'll have opportunities to prove why they should be allowed to explore the spire.  The campaign can be divided into several sections:
1. Spire City - Gain clout, money, or favors until you have access to the cave
2. Spire caves - The meat of the campaign, as almost anything can happen!  Entire worlds are connected inside the caves.
3. Warlock's Castle - Discover the secrets of the spire and why it operates under such strange rules
4. Making Choices - How does the party choose to resolve the crisis they discover in the castle
5. Politics of Power - Nearby nations don't appreciate how quickly Spire City has gained influence and drawn their boldest fighters in.  Fearing the rise of an empire, they band together against the city.
